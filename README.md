# Fibonacci
As is known to all, we all love FIBONACCI as it has such a beautiful style as the art of math. When we coding, we begin with FIBONACCI (despite of dear Hello World). So can you help me coding in your mother tone or your favorate or any language you like, to do an implementation of FIBONACCI?

## Rule
- Implement a fundamental brick (a class, a module, a function, etc) of your langurage.
- Take an integer `n` from STDIN, and output to STDOUT the nth term of [A000045](https://oeis.org/A000045).
- Write any wierd code you want.

## Git
- Make an orphan branch named "(language)-(identifier)" for a new implementation, open a Pull Request to main for code review after implemented.
- Identifier should be related to the feature of the code.
- Put your codes and docs in a folder named "(language)/(identifier)" in the branch.
