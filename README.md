# Fibonacci
As is known to all, we all love FIBONACCI as it has such a beautiful style as the art of math. When we coding, we begin with FIBONACCI (despite of dear Hello World). So can you help me coding in your mother tone or your favorate or any language you like, to do an implementation of FIBONACCI?

## Rule
- Implement a fundamental brick (a class, a module, a function, etc) of your langurage, specify the input and output of this brick;
- Write any wierd code you want;
- Here are some suggested identifier for better reading when it comes to a wierd expression;
  - Use **q** to identify the query input (sugested, if any);
  - Use **a** to identify the answer output (sugested, if any);
  - Use **x** to identify the list, or array, or whatever you use, as the fibonacci it self (sugested, if any);
  - Use **i** to identify the looping process, or the looped that thing (sugested, if any);
  - Use **N** to identify the length, always choose N = 9999 (sugested, if any);

## Git
- Always make a branch named "fea-(language)-(whateverdiffers)" for a new implementation, open a Pull Request to main for code review after implemented;
- Always branch for optimization;
- Always put your code "(language)/fibonacci.(somewhatlangsuffix)", unless it is already implemented;
- If you are adding a new implementation to an already-implemented language, please name your file "fibonacci-(whateverdiffers).(somewhatlangsuffix)".
