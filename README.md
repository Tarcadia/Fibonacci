# Fibonacci
As is known to all, we all love FIBONACCI as it has such a beautiful style as the art of math. When we coding, we begin with FIBONACCI (despite of dear Hello World). So can you help me coding in your mother tone or your favorate or any language you like, to do an implementation of FIBONACCI?

## Rule
Implement a fundamental brick (a class, a module, a function, etc) of your langurage, which with a query _q_, providing _fibonacci[q]_ as an output.
- Use **q** to identify the query input (sugested, if any);
- Use **a** to identify the answer output (sugested, if any);
- Use **x** to identify the list, or array, or whatever you use, as the fibonacci it self (sugested, if any);
- Use **i** to identify the looping process, or the looped that thing (sugested, if any);
- Use **N** to identify the length, always choose N = 9999 (sugested, if any);
- Write any wierd code you want, these identifiers sugested can help other to under stand your code.

## Git
- Always use an orphan branch named "fea-<language>" to commit and merge, or use pull request to merge.
- Always name your file "fibonacci.<somewhat>", unless it is already implemented. If you are adding a new file which is already implemented, please name your file "fibonacci-<whateverdiffers>.<somewhat>"
